# About the British Library's Playbills collection
The British Library holds a considerable collection of Playbills dating from the 
1730s to the 1950s. These are single-sheet items which list entertainments at 
theatres, fairs, pleasure gardens and other such venues. Small 'handbills' 
circulated amongst theatre-goers enjoying the performance and larger 
'great bills' used for posting on walls and windows are assembled in over 1000 
bound volumes, comprising an estimated 234,000 playbills. 

Given the ephemeral nature of Playbills (fires always needed lighting!) we are 
fortunate to have such a large number survive, thanks largely to the zeal of 
known collectors who gathered them together. Titles in characteristic large 
type indicate the range and frequency of popular performances and much-loved 
dramas but, equally important, glimpses the less well-known and even forgotten 
plays. Each Playbill is a glimpse into past entertainments. Some of these 
Playbills have been digitised - and now we need your help to 
bring them back into the spotlight.

# About the *In the Spotlight* project
Our newest crowdsourcing project, *In the Spotlight* is in 'alpha' - that 
means it's work-in-progress and we suspect there are still lots of little 
issues to sort out. 

Please have a go and do let us know what you think: do the instructions 
make sense? Do the tasks work as you expected? Is there too much to 
transcribe, too little? Are you comfortable using the forum to discuss 
the playbills? Are there tasks you'd like to suggest for the pages
you've seen?

You can help by posting feedback on the 
[project forum](https://community.libcrowds.com/), emailing us digitalresearch@bl.uk or tweeting @[BL_DigiSchol](https://twitter.com/BL_DigiSchol).

# How your contributions to *In the Spotlight* make a difference
These preserved Playbills offer a wealth of historical detail with 
thousands of personal names of actors, playwrights, composers, and 
theatre managers. But these promising rich details have been so near 
yet so far from our fingertips because past constraints have left this 
mass of historical print largely uncatalogued. Some volumes are 
listed on [Explore](http://explore.bl.uk) but the entries do not 
expand beyond naming a location (town), particular theatre(s), 
and giving an indication of approximate date(s).

Current catalogue searches cannot recover the level of detail important to 
researchers: no titles; no names of actors, dramatis personae; no dates of 
performance, or details of songs performed. Such indications can be crucial to 
informing and guiding selection of material for closer examination.

By marking and transcribing titles, genres, personal names, locations and dates,
you'll help bring these Playbills back into the spotlight. Transcribed information
will be tidied up and put into the catalogue records, and to further aid research,
the data is always available to download from this site.
